						<p>Assessment 4 tests your knowledge of the HTTP protocol and third-party API's. It is ungraded, but similiar questions are likely to show up on the final exam.</p>  
						<p>The Final Project builds on top of Assesment 4 and is worth 30% of your grade.  It is recommended you complete week 11's lectures and assessment 4 before attempting.  You have a bit over three weeks to complete everything, a full countdown is available on <a href="assessment.html">assessment</a>.</p></p>

						<h3>Course Evaluations Begin 11/24</h3>
						<p>It's your chance to vent any complaints and grievances. The numbers I mostly ignore (Is a 3/5 bad or average?), but the comments I take very seriously.  They are incredibly useful in showing me where students are struggling, as well as identify personal weaknesses in my teaching. Each semester I try to make changes to account for my personal shortfalling in the previous semester, but unfortunately only future cohorts are affected.  I won't see these until much later in Feburary 2021, so if it's something I should fix right away email me instead.</p>

						<h3>Academic Integrity Incident</h3>
						<p>During my initial scan of the exams, a small group of students were caught cheating by submitting answers for questions not assigned to them.</p>
						
						<figure style="margin:2px">
							<img src="image/mt2.png" width="100%"/>
							<figcaption>6 of the 20 possible versions of this question</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>As stated in the Syllabus, I have a zero tolerance policy to any form of academic dishonesty.  These students will be removed from the course with a failing grade, and I have begun the process of filing an academic integrity report with the Office of Student Conduct.</p>
						<p>I post this here to let the rest of the class know that I will do my best to ensure academic integrity is maintained despite being online.  The course average and subsequently exam curves should solely reflects the time and effort students spent on studying the material and not who they are friends with.  If you are studying in a group that is fine, but make sure to avoid the temptation of asking others for help during exams.</p>
						<p>I suspect the same group also worked together on Midterm 1, and as their actions may have harmed the overall class average, I will increase the curve for Midterm 1 from 10 to 11 to adjust for this.  These values will be updated  in a few weeks at the same time that grades for Midterm 2 post.</p>

						<p>Like the previous exam, you have 100 minutes.  There are a total of 7 questions totaling 100 points.  Have a code editor open for the coding question, and a sheet of scrap paper for the routing problem.</p>
						<h4>Access</h4>
						<p>The exam will be accessible on Blackboard once your official class time starts</p>
						<p>Be sure to start the exam within 5 minutes of your official class start time, the exam's content will stop loading after 105 minutes from your official start time.</p>
						
						<p>Once completed, <b>Don't forget to take the Post-Exam Affidavit</b>, Your exam will not be graded until that is submitted.  It should unlock automatically once you submit the midterm</p>
												
						<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
						<p>If you have any technical difficulties, contact me immediately inside Blackboard Collaborate so I have a record of the incident and can help troubleshoot.</p>

						<p>The transport layer lecture is very theoretical, assessment three in contrast is very hands on.  They are designed to compliment each other, as you see specific parts of the TCP/IP header with WireShark.  The programming aspects of this assesment (socket programming) will not be on the second midterm, but doing it will help solidify the theoretical TCP concepts that will be on the exam.  (It gives you examples that you can cite should you need to explain a certain concept in TCP)</p>
						
						<p>Socket Programming may appear on the final.  (You will not be asked questions about WireShark however, as it is just an analysis tool)</p>

						<p>Our next topic will be the Transport Layer. I'll be using this week to clean up the lecture transcript and catch up on missing recordings.  In terms of content, we are a bit ahead of schedule, so this won't effect us much.  Please utilize the extra time to ensure that you understand the most recent lectures and assessments.  This is especially true to those who had trouble with the programming question on the exam, please spend more time on the assesments.  If something is unclear send me an email, I am happy to clarify.</p>
						
						<p>I'll make a more detailed post about common mistakes on exam 1 once everything is graded, but many students were tripped up by the programming question.  If you used a loop in your solution, it was likely incorrect, as synchronous execution requires recursion. (See Lecture 6: N Domains Synchronously and Assessment 1 Exercise 2)</p>

						<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
						<dl>
							<dt>What time is the exam?  I have a conflict during that time with another class.</dt>
							<dd><p>The exam dates are on your syllabus, the time is during your normally scheduled class so a conflict is impossible.  Do not look at the Monday/Wednesday syllabus if you are in the Tuesday/Thursday section.</p></dd>
						
							<dt>Will we be required to use webcams?</dt>
							<dd><p>No</p></dd>
							
							<dt>How detailed do you want answers?</dt>
							<dd><p>Detailedness is not something measurable.  The exam will have 100 points and there will be 100 minutes to complete the test.  I'd recommend spending no more than the point value in minutes per question.  </p>
							<p>If a question is worth 10points, answer as detailed as you can within a 10 minute constraint.  I also recommend keeping your phone on the side to set up timers to let you know when you should move on.</p></dd>
							
							<dt>Can we use the code that you've supplied us?</dt>
							<dd><p>Yes</p></dd>
							
							<dt>If the explanation is based on the lecture/lecture notes, should we quote it?</dt>
							<dd><p>You do not need to quote any material that I've created.</p>
							
							<p>You should quote and cite if it's from a third party resource that I've linked, (There is no "penalty" for not doing this, but you are more likely to get full credit right away if your referencing the correct resource, instead of having me play detective on what you meant)</p>
							
							<p>For other resources not listed on my website, (eg. found via search on  google) you must paraphrase it and cite your sources.  I would avoid this if possible as I haven't vetted those resources and if turns out  incorrect, you will be penalized.</p>
							
							</dd>
							
							<dt>Are you really in our WeChat/Discord groups?</dt>
							<dd><p>Yes, please follow course guidelines when chatting with fellow students and <b>definitely don't do it during exams</b>.  I do not require students to install intrusive software or have webcams, but I take academic integrity very seriously.</p></dd>

					<p>This weeks topic is Asynchronous Programming.  It is fundamentally important to this course, it is also one of the hardest topics.  Please allocate sufficient time to run all the demos and watch the supplemental videos.</p>
					<p>Once you have finished running all the demo's try to complete the assesments.  Your exams will each contain similiar programming problems, so it's important to complete them.</p>
					<p>If you have any problem running the code or questions on the materials, reach out to me as soon as possible.</p>

You will always have at least a week to digest material, before I consider it viable for any exams.  In this way I try to never penalize students for delays on my part</p>
					
					<p>I've received some comments about volume issues of the previous videos, I've ordered some new recording equipment which should be delivered by next week.</p>

						<p>I'd recommend completing as many of the Basic JavaScript and ES6 demos as possible. Feel free to skip around, many of the earlier demos can feel a bit patronizing with how simple they are. Next week we will begin looking at more complex features of JavaScript - specifically closures and asynchronous programming, so make sure you are familiar with the syntax.</p>

				<h2>Activities for Week 0</h2>
				<time>2020 - 08 - 20</time>
				<section class="article-content">
					<p>Welcome to CS 355</p>
					<p>If you are reading this you area bit ahead of the class.  Classes officially start on August 26th and to avoid needing to keep track of which students were emailed and last minute registerations, I won't be contacting students via email until the 26th.</p>
					<p>Currently all the documents are in a state of flux as I start my scripting and recording process for each of the lectures.  Many documents will disappear from the website as I reset the course from the previous semester, but most of them will come back as the weeks progress to ensure students are not overloaded.</p>
					<p>Once the semester starts you should expect a total of 14 weekly posts similar to this, but included will be a list of required readings, videos, assessments, and other content to consume.</p>
					<p>Please hold any questions that you may have until August 26th.  The syllabus which is currently going through department approval will be uploaded by then and should answer most of the questions (including all questions related to grading).  This allows me to focus my time and effort into creating content to ensure the course kicks off successfully.</p>
					<p>This course is built around Open educational resources (OER).  Both of the required textbooks are free and available on the Course Materials page.</p>
					
					<p>I wish you the best and hope you find this course enjoyable.</p>

				<h2>Welcome to CS 355: Internet and Web Technologies</h2>
				<time>2020 - 08 - 26</time>
				<section class="article-content">
					<p>This course is an introduction to the technologies behind the Internet and World Wide Web directed toward computer science majors.  We will be taking a deep dive into the TCP / IP Model.  Learning the protocols on each layer and how they interact with each other.  We will look at various protocols at each layer, understand their purpose, data structures and underlying algorithms.</p>
					<p>TLS and HTTPS will be coverd, we will explore the security protocol's used on the web and how data encryption works over hostile channels.  We will learn the technology behind Virtual Private Network and how anyone can use this technology to stretch their local networks across the globe.</p>
					<p>On the programming-end we will be using JavaScript.  We will explore functional, asynchronous, and event-driven programming.  We will learn about class-free object oriented programming, as well as write code for both TCP and HTTP servers using the Node.js runtime environment.</p>
					<p>We will be creating web applications and exploring the Representational State Transfer software architectural style to both consume and create RESTful APIs.  We will discuss caching techniques and see how they can be applied not just for it's performance benefits, but improved reliability as well.</p>
					
					<p>My Teaching Philosophy is influenced heavily by Cal Newport (Deep Work, Digital Minimalism).  I like system solutions; tools and resources that I can build once and reuse indefinitely.  The core of my work revolves around creating content and giving lectures for each of my classes.  Things that distract me from this I try to either automate away, delegate to a specialist, or minimize from my life with rules.</p>
					<p>In graded assignments I make use of rubrics to telegraph my expectations to students.  I try my best to create questions that can be self-assessed, so students can actively track their performance.</p>
					<p>As a rule I do not extended due dates as it creates unwanted work for me.  I treat grading assignments the same way sanitation worker's treat picking up trash; something clearly unpleasant, but part of the job.  Accepting work past the cutoff however, is not part of my job description.</p>
					<p>Under the course material, I've set up an E-mail FAQ which I advise all students check before contacting me as I hope to resolve your questions as fast as possible.  Each additional round of emails is not just more work for me, but downtime for students as they wait for my response, so it's in the best interest of students to be as detailed as possible.  I try not to look at my email too often, as my time is better spent creating content, so factor in up to 24 hours for each response.</p>
					<p>I wish you the best and hope you find this course enjoyable.</p>

				<h2>Grades have been sent to CUNY first.</h2>
				<time>2020 - 05 - 28</time>
				<section class="article-content">
					
					<p>Individual grades will be slowly added to the website, use the syllabus and the rebalancing formula if you opted in to the to calculate your numeric total.</p>
					<p>First congratulations to everyone who successfully completed the course.  This course, in my opinion is one of the more difficult courses of our CS major, especially so if you either had no prior experience with server side JavaScript or had to unlearn abstractions that almost all other online courses gloss over.</p>
					<p>To those who did not finish with the requisite 60, I know it's discouraging, but I would urge you to try again in a future semester, as a failure in this class only signifies that you did not reach my threshold of satisfactory understanding of the material within the current semester.  That is to say, you are not there yet, but you can definitely get there with some more studying.</p>
					
					<h3>Final Presentations</h3>
					<p>During the past month, I had the pleasure of conducting 50 final presentations, many utilizing some extremely interesting APIs.</p>
					<img src="image/final-presentations.jpg" "Final Presentation Calender" width="100%"/>
					
					<p>Some notable examples include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>GDrive + CocktailDB: Create downloadable drink recipes that uploaded to GDrive</li>
						<li>Twitch + QRTag: Create QR codes for popular streamers</li>
						<li>NYTimes + Ebay: Show all ebay listings of the daily NY Times best seller for a given date</li>
						<li>Twitter + Google Maps: Display a Map of the city where a tweet was made</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>Code</h3>
					<p>After the semester is over, the restriction on posting code to VCS repositories like GitHub is lifted.  All I ask is that you do not mention CS355 in the repos and do not link to my website.</p>

<p>This is to minimize the value that future students who are tempted to search for solutions get.  From past experience, a minority of students, either through frustration (or disappointingly through instinct if they've had success in the past), search for solutions for exercises instead of doing them.  I do make changes to assignments between semesters to catch this, but this is only one strategy and a successful defense should have multiple components.</p>

<p>I know I can't eliminate this behavior completely, but I still aim to make it incredibly hard.  Using a combination of transparency with previous students, harsh punishments for students caught, significant visible changes to assignments between each semester, and Stanford Moss for automated detection, hopefully I can set that inconvenience bar high enough that it's not worth copying.</p>

					<h3>Course Material</h3>
					<p>The course material will be available for at least until July.  Around August I'll be making changes to the course for the next cohort, so the website is not guaranteed to be available.</p>

<p>You are free to make a personal copy of all documents that I created for this course under a no derivatives, no redistribution license.</p>

<p>Please do not post course material that I've created on external websites including Chegg, Course Hero, or a shared Google Docs / Drive.  I'd like my website to be the sole place students go to when preparing.  Any mistakes that I make, I can quickly amend, which is not the case if it gets uploaded elsewhere.  My goal with this guideline is to minimize the use of these unsanctioned repositories, and prevent prospective students from legitimizing material they find there (often from many semesters ago), as a defense against plagiarism accusations.</p>

<p>Material you personally created, like notes created during lectures do not fall under this guideline as long as they do not use resources like code or images that I've supplied.  That's yours and you should be able to do anything you want with it.</p>
					
					<h3>Canceled Topics & Further Resources</h3>
					
					<p>Due to the pandemic, many topics had to be cancelled as I could not find the time to record lectures on these and I wanted students to devote their time to graded elements.  In the next few days I'll be adding links to the following topics, should you be interested in studying further.</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Network Congestion</li>
						<li>DNS</li>
						<li>Encryption</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>In addition I've listed some resources under this post, which points to additional resources for more advanced topics, should you be interested in specializing in web tech.</p>
					
					<h3>Contact</h3>
					<p>I'll be responding to emails for the next week normally, After June 6th, I'll be setting up an out of office responder until the Fall semester.</p>
					
					
					<h3>Feedback</h3>
					<p>As it looks right now, Queens College may not be doing course evaluations this semester, which I've always found valuable.  If you want to leave anonymous feedback I've set up a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgceGfWMb4Hbmu4ZoMjKSCHO2k-vEPsGB2ZFeM5Bu64mZ5Dg/viewform?usp=sf_link" style="color:blue">Google Form here</a> , all feedback is taken seriously and is used to improve the course for future cohorts.</p>
					
					
					<h3>Additional Questions</h3>
					<p>What does Received/Ungraded mean?</p>
					<p>I graded each item in descending weight order (Final, A5, A4, A3) and utilized short circuit grading if passing was no longer possible.  If at any point your Maximum Possible Grade dipped below the requisite 60 (Assuming perfect scores on everything ungraded), I assigned a grade of "Received/Ungraded" to the rest of the submitted material and skipped grading them to ensure all grades would be entered in time.  If you want feedback I can grade these (email me), but it will only further lower your grade.</p>
					
					<p>I wish you the best of luck in your future ventures!</p>

					<h3>Promises</h3>
					<p>Promises are good to learn after finishing the course.  In this course I purposely don't cover promises and restricted their usage in most assignments as they are an advanced feature that is often used in a limited fashion to abstract away the notion of callbacks, a fundamental topic in this course.</p>
					<p>Now that the course is over however, a good first resource to delve into promises and the microtask queue is the video: Asynchrony: Under the Hood by Shelley Vohr.</p>
					<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrNQS8J67zc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrNQS8J67zc</a></p>
					<p>You get so much more value out of learning promises if you first master callbacks.</p>

					<p><span style="background-color:yellow">(New 2020/05/17)</span> The final video has been uploaded. The demo files have minor changes to variable names to be more descriptive, and while everything should still work regardless of version.  To have the best experience that matches the videos, I would suggest downloading a new copy of the api-demos.zip.</p>
					
					<p>(2020/05/15) I've uploaded the video on OAuth 2.0 Three Legged Flow.  I still have one last video to script and record, hopefully this one should be quick to upload since it's purely code.  Once that last video is uploaded I'll be finished creating material for this semester and can get to grading.</p>

					<p>I've extended the cutoff for assignment 5 until Sunday night to give you the weekend.  Next week you should be scheduling your Final Presentations.  If you haven't picked a date already check the reservations slots daily, if there is more demand than supply I will add additional slots to ensure everyone can present.</p>
					
					<h3>Additional clarifications on the final project from previous presentations:</h3> <p>There should not be any additional user input between the first API call and the second one.  The user should not need to do anything (including clicks) after the first API call to make the second API call occur.  It should be two synchronous requests (one after the other), not two seperate requests.</p>
					
					<p>More formally there should be at least one round trip request between the user and our server, such that during that request, both API's are queried synchronously before a response is sent back.</p>

				<h2>Final Project Posted</h2>

				<section class="article-content">
					<p>I've posted the details of the final project under assignments.  It involves three phases:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Choosing a pair of APIs</li>
						<li>Writing the program and documenting it with a sequence diagram</li>
						<li>A 10~15 minute presentation over Cisco WebEx where you will demo your project.</li></p>
					</ol>
				
					<p>This will be the last graded element of the semester and you will have until May 22nd to complete all three phases.</p>
					
					<p>The next set of videos will detail how OAuth 2.0 works more formally (You've already had some practice with it in Assignment 4).  I'm currently in the writing stage of the programs necessary for the videos, but video production should be faster, now that I don't have to create anymore homeworks.</p>
					
					<p>As always, if you are stuck with any assignment either email me (use the dropbox link under email FAQs to submit code), or book an office hours appointment.</p>

					<h3>Comments</h3>
					<p>A5 Code: The code originally supplied had some invisible characters that caused errors of type "Invalid or unexpected token".  I've fixed a few of them, but these have been difficult for me to track down in general and part of the reason why most of the code samples I give you were images.  If you receive such errors, submit your code to me (link via dropbox uploads) and I will get back to you.</p>

				<h2>Assignment 5 Posted</h2>
				<time>2020 - 04 - 24</time>
				<section class="article-content">
					<p>I've started to receive submissions for Assignment 4 and to minimize student downtime I'm releasing Assignment 5 with a longer deadline.  The scope of the Assignment 5 has been reduced due to limited time.  For a typical student I would expect this assignment to be doable over a weekend, but the due date is much longer because of the overlapping due dates with other graded elements.</p>
					<p>Information regarding the Final Project will be posted this weekend.</p>
					<p>A lot of students seem to be stuck on the very last step generating the webpage, here are some additional hints</p>
					<p>To generating the webpage, we need to generate an HTML document that contains albums.length URLs.  Images are only fetched and render in the browser if they are enclosed in <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code> tags.  Since we need to display multiple images, we should add image tags that reference images found in the album-art directory.  These tags are nothing more than text.  We can loop through the URLs (type string)  and wrap them with the required tag formating.  The final step involves joining the results into a single string and using res.end() to send the webpage.  Pseudocode below:</p>  
					
					<p>
					<code>
<pre>
let img_tags = [];<br/>
for(let i=0 ; i&lt;albums.length ;i++){<br/>
    img_tags[i] = `&lt;img src="${all_img_paths[i]}" /&gt;`;<br/>
}<br/>
res.end(img_tags.join(""));
</pre></code>

					<p>Two more cases of plagarism were discovered while grading through assignment 2.  An academic integrity report has been filed with the Student Conduct offices regarding these incidents.</p>
					<p>In previous semesters covering this course, Assignment 4 is where Stanford Moss detects most of it's plagarism incidents as your submission file is no longer several tiny files, but a single massive one.</p>
					
					<p>Be mindful not to copy solutions that you may find online, as I introduce minor changes each semester to detect this.  All submissions from previous semsters are also fed in to Moss's dataset for speedy detection.  Be careful to keep all discussions on a high level, and not to share code.  Instead direct all questions to me either via email or office hours.</p>

Ideally I'd like students who require office hours to book at least 12 hours ahead so I can schedule you in properly, but the software doesn't seem any mechanism for me to prevent last minute reservations.  Please ensure all bookings are made at least 12 hours ahead, otherwise I might not be able to make it.  I'm gauging how many slots to open based on last weeks response, if you don't see any slots open, check back tomorrow and I will open more up.  If you feel your question or questions may require more than 15 minutes, book a 7:15 slot and I can stay longer.</p>

					<p>A4 album-art: Placeholder images for album art were initially missing, this has been fixed</p>
					
					<p>In early April, CUNY passed a CR/NC policy for this semester that allows students to convert individual grades into CR/NC up to 20 days after the semester ends.  This changes the optimal strategy as a student to the following:
						<ul>
							<li>If you pass a class and it raises your GPA keep the letter grade.</li>
							<li>If you pass a class, but it lowers GPA convert it to CR.</li>
							<li>If you fail a class, convert it to NC.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>As this is an individual decission made after the semester ends, It doesn't effect us as a class, except I needed to void the Convert to F option in the survey previously taken, (as any grade above an F is considered passing this semester).  I'm unsure of the details on how this will be implemented (likely through CUNY First), but the college will make an announcement as the semester comes to an end.  My knowledge regarding the details of CR/NC are limited, please contact the advising center if you need further clarifications.</p>

				<h2>Graded elements and the course going forward</h2>
				<time>2020 - 03 - 21</time>
				<section class="article-content">
					<p>Assignment 01 and the Midterm Exam has been graded.  If you don't see your grade for these contact me.  The curve for the midterm exam was 7 points (displayed score includes curve).  The exam average was 60%.</p>
					
					<p>Stanford Moss has detected two cases of plagarism this semester (Confirmed by finding identical errors).  An academic integrity report has been filed with the Student Conduct offices regarding this case.  As we make the shift toward assignments being more valuable, be mindful not to copy solutions that you may find online, as I introduce minor changes each semester to detect this.  Be careful to keep all discussions on a high level, and not to share code.</p>
					
					<p>Going forward the class will shift to an asynchronous format.  Lecture videos will begin to be posted some time next week, the initial videos might take a few extra days as I'm still waiting for equipment to be delivered, but I'll continue recording through Spring Break to ensure all the remaining material is covered.</p>
					<p>As for grades, 32% of the course points are locked in.  The final project will take on the form of a fifth assignment (details TBA) and the final examination will take on the form of a coding project (details TBA).</p>
										
					<p>An estimated final grade can be calculated using the formula:</p>
					<p><code>Assignment Average * 75% + Midterm Exam * 25%</code></p>
					<p>but since Assignment 02 hasn't been graded, yet you will have to guestimate that value based on how you think you did.</p>
					<p>The current syllabus is unbalanced for the unprecedented reality we face ourselves in so I've created an optional change that rebalances the point values of the remaining assignments as follows.</p>
					<p>Original</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Assignment 03 - TCP/IP: <strong>4%</strong></li>
						<li>Assignment 04 - OAuth2: <strong>4%</strong></li>
						<li>Assignment 05 - (TBA): <strong>15%</strong></li>
						<li>Coding Project - (TBA): <strong>45%</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Rebalanced:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Assignment 03 - TCP/IP: <strong>12%</strong></li>
						<li>Assignment 04 - OAuth2: <strong>13%</strong></li>
						<li>Assignment 05 - (TBA): <strong>13%</strong></li>
						<li>Coding Project - (TBA): <strong>30%</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>As the syllabus is a pseudo-contract between faculty and student these changes must be opted into.  I've created a form where students can submit their decissions.  The deadline to make a decission is one week from the posting of this announcement, all students who do not choose will default to the original conditions set forth on the syllabus.</p>
					
					<p><a style="color:blue" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUJmn6PEKuUNKex7YzFtt0S4yz8BYhs6Dvyl6OI7g5SZUyzA/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank" >Optional Grading Policy Change Form</a></p>
					
					<p>As for work you can do immediately, Assignment 3 has been posted.  This assignment demonstrates the details of the TCP/IP model using a network traffic capturing tool WireShark.  It's a bit rough as I had to rush through some major changes (due to not being able to accept hard copies), please let me know if you find typos or mistakes.</p>

				<h2>Update regarding COVID-19 shutdown of CUNY</h2>
				<time>2020 - 03 - 12</time>
				<section class="article-content">
					<p>The university has cancelled classes from 3/12 to 3/18 as faculty try to piece together a plan of transition.  CUNY's original decision to not shift to distance learning and Governor Cuomo's reversal have taken the entire CS department by surprise.  We are working as fast as possible to come up with a fair plan that will work for as many students as possible, but it's highly likely some concessions will be required from all parties.  I will have more information on how I see this course moving forward in the next few days.</p>
					<p>I have extended the cutoff date for Assignment 2 by one week due to the extreme situation, however Assignment 3 will be posted next week (creating overlapping due dates)</p>
					<p>For now please remember to check the website daily as required.  As this will be my primary mode of direct communication with the class going forward, it is more important now than ever.</p>

					<h3>Comments</h3>
					<p>A2 Q4: Added Clarification: Matches should be case insensitive.</p>
					<p>A2 Q5: Added Clarification: <code>start()</code> vs <code>constructor()</code> behavior</p>
					<p>A2 Q5: Added line <code>constructor(message = "MYSECRETMESSAGE")</code> to MorseEmitter.js to better convey the required task for part 2.</p>
					<p>Fixed a Typo on the midterm dates, 3/11 for MW sections, 3/10 for TTh sections (Normal Class Time)</p>
					
					<p>The midterm examination is scheduled for 3/11 for MW sections and 3/10 for TTh sections.  Topics 1 to 11 and assignments 1 and 2 will be on the midterm exam.  There will be two coding questions on the exam (one on asynchronous programming and one on observer pattern).  The rest of the exam will be algorithmic in nature (Explain how protocol X works / What is the algorithm to solve Y?  What are the steps?).  You will be supplied a reference for all message headers (Ethernet / 802.11 Frames, IP Packet, TCP Segment) so there is no need to memorize them.</p>

					</ul>
					<h3>Comments</h3>
					
					<p>I've made some minor changes to Assignment 01's starting template in response to a question asking for clarification of input size.  (One or two lines on each file giving a sample value for n)  A student was wondering how to accept user input for size n.  You don't have to do that, just hardcode a constant n on top and I will change it.  I don't think this should effect anybody, but you can redownload the template and see the changes yourself.</p>
					
					<p>From covering the three sections, one consistent question was === (Identical) vs. == (Equivalent) usage.  Double equals has an implicit type coersion applied to it.  In Douglas Crockford's The Good Parts, double equals is considered a bad part of JavaScript and should be avoided.  The argument being that as a developer, you should strive to write code that is as explicit as possible.  When using double equals there is a <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3" target="_blank">laundry list of equivalent values that you have to memorize</a>, some of which are counterintuitive.</p>
					<p>That said, I don't have the same fervor to demonize it, as I have never encountered any of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotcha_(programming)" target="_blank">gotchas</a> associated with implicit type coersion due to my refusal to use this "tool" in my personal projects to begin with.  The tradeoffs for using the triple equals (one additional character on each comparison and an explicit cast when I do need to compare elements of different types <code>Number(num_string) === 123</code>) in my opinion, are worth never having to worry about whether there is some weird edge case I'm not thinking of.</p>
					<p>As with all style recommendations, follow your employer's style guide.  Be passionate and opinionated about style on personal projects, but not when you have to work with 20 other people.</p>
					
					<p>But if you only use ===, you get to ignore all of this content:</p>

					<h3>Topic 1: OSI Model and Physical Layer</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="course.html#osi">OSI and TCP/IP Conceptual Models</a></li>
						<li><a href="course.html#physical">Physical Layer</a></li>

					</ul>
					<h3>Comments</h3>
					<p>On the course materials page, I've linked to the FreeCodeCamp.com JavaScript tutorial where there are resources to practice the syntax of JavaScript.  For those new to the language I would recommend completing the entire tutorial, but if you are proficient with JavaScript already, they can be skipped (in the sense that I won't be grading anything, but you still need to know the content). </p> 
					<p>Regardless of how you gauge your personal JavaScript ability, I would recommend doing a few of these exercises, if nothing else, it builds the habit of doing some amount of studying.  Next week we will be going deeper into the internals of how JavaScript works, so I am expecting students to have a strong command of the syntax by then.</p>
